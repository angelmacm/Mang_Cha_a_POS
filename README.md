# Mang_Cha_a_POS
 
A Point-of-sale System that was created using Python as its programming language and SQLite as its database software
 
This program was made for the final project for my Second semester of second year in college. The aim was to make a Point-of-Sale system for the small businesses in our local communities which needed the program. We found this shop and asked a permission if they can be the business requirement for this project.
